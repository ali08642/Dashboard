## üìä Main Dashboard: Finding Business Leads

Think of this like **hunting for business opportunities** in a systematic way:

### **Step 1: Pick Your Market**

- **Why:** Different countries have different business opportunities
- **Example:** You might choose "Pakistan" because you want to find local businesses there
- **Result:** The system loads all major cities in that country

### **Step 2: Choose Your City & Find Business Areas**
- **What it does:** Pick a specific city, then the system finds all the business districts
- **Why:** Every city has different neighborhoods where businesses cluster
- **Example:** You pick "Lahore" and the system finds areas like "Mall Road Commercial District", "DHA Business Area", "Gulberg Market Zone"
- **How it works:** AI analyzes the city and identifies where businesses are most concentrated

### **Step 3: Get Smart Recommendations**
- **What it does:** Shows you all the business areas found, plus gives you an option to get more targeted suggestions
- **The magic button:** "Create Context-Based Areas" - you tell it what type of businesses you want (like "restaurants", "tech companies", "car dealers")

## ‚öôÔ∏è Scraping Jobs: The Business Hunting Process

### **How Business Discovery Works**

#### **Think of it like assigning research tasks:**

**Job Creation:**
- You pick a business area (like "Downtown Karachi")
- System creates a "research assignment" to find all businesses there
- This becomes a "scraping job"

**Smart Job Distribution:**
- **The Problem:** You have multiple team members but limited capacity
- **The Solution:** System automatically assigns work based on who's available

#### **Real-World Example:**
```
You have 3 team members:
- Ahmed: Can handle 3 jobs at once
- Sara: Can handle 5 jobs at once  
- Hassan: Can handle 2 jobs at once

When you create 10 research jobs:
- Ahmed gets 3 jobs and starts working
- Sara gets 5 jobs and starts working
- Hassan gets 2 jobs and starts working
- When Ahmed finishes 1 job, he automatically gets assigned the next pending job
```

**Job Status Tracking:**
- **Pending:** Waiting in line to be worked on
- **Running:** Someone is actively researching that area
- **Completed:** All businesses found and cataloged
- **Failed:** Something went wrong, needs to be retried

- **Conversion tracking:** Which leads become customers
- **ROI analysis:** Which areas give you the best return
